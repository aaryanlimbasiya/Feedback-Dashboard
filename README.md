# Feedback Dashboard

This project is a simple feedback management system that allows users to share their experience and see the overall response through a clean dashboard. It includes a feedback form where users can submit their name, email, message, and rating. All submitted feedback is collected and displayed in a dashboard format that highlights overall activity in a simple and understandable way.

The dashboard presents an overview of the feedback submitted, showing general trends such as how many responses have been received, what the overall rating looks like, and how many users had positive or negative experiences. It also includes a recent feedback section where the latest entries are shown in a readable format. Along with this, side information such as common issues, satisfaction levels, and helpful actions provide additional context and improve understanding of the feedback.

This project demonstrates how a frontend interface and backend service can work together to collect and display information. The interface is kept simple with a clean orange theme, making it easy for users to navigate and understand. The backend ensures that feedback entries are stored and retrieved properly. Overall, this dashboard offers a clear and structured way to handle user responses and observe feedback trends in a straightforward manner.
